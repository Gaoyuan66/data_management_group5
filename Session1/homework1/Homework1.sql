1. 
Write a SELECT statement that returns four columns FROM the Products table: product_code, product_name, list_price, and discount_percent. 
Then, run this statement to make sure it works correctly.
Add an ORDER BY clause to this statement that sorts the result set by list price in DESCending sequence. 
Then, run this statement again to make sure it works correctly. 
This is a good way to build and test a statement, one clause at a time.

2. 
Write a SELECT statement that returns one column FROM the Customers table named full_name that joins the lASt_name and first_name columns.
Format this column with the lASt name, a comma, a space, and the first name like this:
Doe, John
Sort the result set by the lASt_name column in ASCending sequence.
Return only the customers whose lASt name begins with letters FROM M to Z.
NOTE: When comparing strings of characters, ‘M’ comes before any string of characters that begins with ‘M’. 
For example, ‘M’ comes before ‘Mulligan’.
